# Welcome!

Hazelcast .NET brings the full power of the [Hazelcast](https://hazelcast.com) high-performance, in-memory computing platform to the Microsoft .NET ecosystem. The [Hazelcast .NET Client](https://hazelcast.com/clients/dotnet/) allows you to elastically scale your .NET caches at high read speeds, to access all of Hazelcast data structures such as distributed maps, queues, topics and more. All, with enterprise level security through SSL and mutual authentication.

On this site you can find:

<table class="hz-welcome">
<tr>
<td>General [documentation](latest/doc/index.html) for latest version of the .NET Client: introductions, guides, examples and FAQs. If unsure, this is your best bet.</td>
<td>Complete [reference documentation](latest/api/index.html) for the latest version of the .NET Client public API, generated from source-code-level comments.</td>
<td>Documentation for [all versions](versions.md) of the .NET Client. This includes past versions, and may also include previews of future versions.</td>
</tr>
</table>

Hazelcast .NET only provides a client-side implementation, and needs to connect to a fully configured Hazelcast cluster. Refer to the [Hazelcast General Documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/home/index.html) for a complete documentation of the server side of Hazelcast.

The Hazelcast .NET solution is Open Source, released under the [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), and welcomes contributions. The project lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-csharp-client). In the documentation you can also find out how to obtain the source code, build the solution, interact with the community, and contribute. 

Oh, and a documentation documentation site is, usually, a never-ending work-in-progress. Documentation itself is open to contributions, too. Find anything that you think could be improved? Reach out to us!
